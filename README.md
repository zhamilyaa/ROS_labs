# ROS LABS
## LAB 3 
### PART 1

**TASK:** Create a rosnode that will “listen” for std_msgs/Float64 type data and “publish” this 
data to the joint of the planar robot. The node should send the command to move if 
the any new incoming value is lower than the previous one. 

Below can be seen images when position of joint 4 and 3 were changed.
